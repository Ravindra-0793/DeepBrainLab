    "Description": "This dataset contains processed video data analyzed using DeepLabCut (DLC). The data includes frame-level positional information for tracked features on two rats, such as snout, ears, and spine, along with likelihood scores for detection accuracy. Additionally, the dataset includes positional data for reference markers (red and blue LEDs) and frame timestamps.",
