    "Description": "This Arduino script is designed for controlling behavioral experiments involving rats. It manages LED-based guidance, sequence learning, reward systems, and button press detection for memory tasks. The code integrates features such as:\n- Multi-step reward dispensing mechanisms.\n- Configuration for multiple experimental protocols (e.g., early training, sequence learning, retrieval).\nThe script interacts with hardware components like DotStar LEDs and buttons to provide dynamic visual guidance and reward signaling.",
