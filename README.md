# DeepBrainLab: Advanced Neuroscience Research Tools

Welcome to the **DeepBrainLab** GitHub repository. We are dedicated to developing open-source tools that facilitate cutting-edge neuroscience research, focusing on the intricate connections between neural activity and observable behaviors in freely moving rats.

## Features

- **Neural Activity Analysis**: Tools for recording and analyzing deep brain electrophysiological data.
- **Behavioral Studies**: Software to design and analyze memory enhancement and behavioral experiments.
- **Closed-Loop Brain-Machine Interfaces**: Resources for developing and implementing closed-loop systems integrating neural recordings and stimulations.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilities for visualizing complex neural and behavioral data.

## About

**DeepBrainLab** is part of the **Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology**, supported by the Polonez Bis 3 program, funded by the National Science Centre and the European Union. Our mission is to unravel the connection between neural activity and behavior, aiming to develop clinically relevant closed-loop brain-machine interfaces.
